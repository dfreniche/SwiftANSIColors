# Swift ANSI Colors

> a small "library" to print ANSI colored Swift strings to console


![](img/swift-ANSI-colors.png)


This is aimed at Swift command-line programs launched as scripts that need to do some colored output

## How to Use

Just download this repo, or `SwiftANSIColors.swift`, then copy & paste in your Swift script the relevant parts (yes, Swift scripts still don't allow importing other files...)

Launch this Swift script from the command line:

    $ swift SwiftANSIColors.swift
